## Overview
Welcome to my NFT Marketplace Full-Stack Development project! This comprehensive project showcases the end-to-end creation of a decentralized NFT marketplace, combining blockchain technology, smart contracts, and a feature-rich frontend with Next.js. This project covers everything from smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain to building a responsive and dynamic frontend using Next.js, connecting smart contract with the frontend and using Node.Js for extra website features.
